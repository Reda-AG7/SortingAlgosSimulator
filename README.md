## Sorting Algorithms Implementation ##
---------------------------------------

This project is a C++ implementation of common sorting algorithms, including Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The project utilizes the SFML library for 2D rendering.

Introduction
------------

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are employed in various applications. This project provides implementations of popular sorting algorithms in C++.

Algorithms
----------

### Insertion Sort O(n^2)

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is efficient for small datasets.

### Selection Sort O(n^2)

Selection Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the input array into a sorted and an unsorted region.

### Bubble Sort O(n^2)

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Heap Sort O(nlog(n))

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to build a sorted array.

### Merge Sort O(nlog(n))

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

### Quick Sort O(nlog(n))

Quick Sort is another divide and conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays.

SFML Integration
----------------

SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is integrated into the project for 2D rendering. This allows for visually representing the sorting process in a graphical user interface.

Usage
-----

To use this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have SFML installed.
3.  Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.

Dependencies
------------

-   C++ Compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
-   SFML Library
